# GitReference-project

## DUE: 01 Mar 2018

## Instructions:

Create an app that reads a json file of Git commands and displays all of the commands via a **ListView**. A GitReference.json file is provided.
~~~~ 
{
	  "command":"clone",
	  "example":"git clone ssh://user@domain.com/repo.git",
	  "explanation":"Clone an existing repository",
	  "section":"Create"
}
  ~~~~
Each item in the **ListView** should display the commnad, code example, explanation. There should be a small amount of spacing inbetween each list item and the list should be scrollable. A **WOW** factor could be to create a way to filter by section or a way to add your own Git commands and those commands would be written to the json file. 
                

### TODO:
1. Open Android Studio and create an Android project named GitReference.
2. Edit .gitignore file and put the neccessary file names that do not belong in GitHub.
3. Create a README.md and put '\#README' in it.
4. VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on GitHub. Use 'Initial Commit' as commit message.
5. Verify files were uploaded to your GitHub account.
6. Complete the project.
7. Commit and Push your completed project code to GitHub.
8. Print out any source and resource files (in a readable manner) along with screenshots of app working to hand in. Highlight your WOW factors if you have any.
 
 
 ### Grading:
 
 The above requirements are for a 'B'. In order to achieve an 'A', then you must implement a **WOW** factor. This is normally something that you will have to think of and research how to do it yourself. For this first assignment, styling would be considered. 
 
 ***Note:*** Any issues you have with either the GitHub steps or Java/Android questions should be asked publically on Slack. If you have a question, chances are someone else does also. If you see someone has posted a question on Slack and you know the answer, please chime in and answer.
